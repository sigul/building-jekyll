A simple test.
I wanted to learn Jekyll by building a minimal website.

The Selective Archive only works with master version of Jekyll. In previous version of Jekyll is not possibile to use more than 2 binary operators with where_exp in archive layout. Remove it to fix or run Jekyll master version locally and copy the _site content in docs folder to be able to use it in github.
